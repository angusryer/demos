# Simple React Components
### `Morning challenge | javascript, react`

## Learning Objectives
- creating functional components
- practice writing JSX
- componentizing existing code

## Instructions
- run the command `npm install` inside of your downloaded project.
- run the command `npm start` inside of your downloaded project. This will start a web server that will show you the app.
- identify relevant components that could be used to create the app given the current HTML structure. 
- in `App.js`, create Functional React Components for each component you identify, (e.g. for the *header*, you might have a *Header* component). 
  - Add them to `App.js`, you donâ€™t need to put them in separate files at this point.
- **ensure that everything looks the same**, except now you have components for each part of the web page.
